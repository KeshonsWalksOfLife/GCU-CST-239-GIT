## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **Java console-based application** that simulates a basic bookstore storefront. It demonstrates **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles like abstraction, encapsulation, and modular design. The user can browse a list of books, purchase items, manage their shopping cart, and view a checkout total.

2. Sample books are added to the inventory.
3. User is presented with a menu:
   - View available books
   - Purchase a book by title
   - View their cart
   - Cancel purchase (clears cart)
   - Checkout and view total
4. Inventory updates automatically when purchases are made
