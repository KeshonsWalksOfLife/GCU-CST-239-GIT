## üìå Project Overview

This is a **Java console-based application** that simulates a basic bookstore storefront. It demonstrates **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles like abstraction, encapsulation, and modular design. The user can browse a list of books, purchase items, manage their shopping cart, and view a checkout total.
